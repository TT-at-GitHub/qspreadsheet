# TODO: 

- Recognize completion of rows in progress

- Redesign filters - especially FilterListWidget

- Implement Undo/Redo

- Implement editing multiple cells at the same time

- Implement statusbar or maybe some snackbar messaging system

- Memorize selections, so that insert row works on consecutive rows, 
  if they are selected individually.

- When double clicking cell in nullable column, editor must take focus 
(and perhaps a selecting current data should be the default)

- Investigate entering edit mode, when user starts typing over cell

- Experiment with 'formula bar' to make multi-cell editing easier
